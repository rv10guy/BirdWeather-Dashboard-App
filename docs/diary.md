### Current Status
The bird detections API function is fully functional and provides detailed information about each bird detection event. The implementation correctly retrieves and transforms data from the BirdWeather GraphQL API, with support for filtering by species, time period, and result limits. Testing confirms that the function handles both all-species and specific-species queries correctly.

### Next Steps
- Implement function to retrieve bird species information
- Add function to get station status and metadata
- Create function for weather data integration
- Integrate API functions with Flask routes
- Update frontend to use the real-time detection data

## [2025-03-13] Backend API Integration: Bird Detection Counts

### Summary
Implemented the first phase of backend integration with the BirdWeather API. Created a utility module to fetch real-time bird detection data from the BirdWeather GraphQL API, replacing the need for mock data. This lays the foundation for connecting the dashboard to real data sources.

### Key Features Implemented
- **BirdWeather API Configuration**:
  - Added API endpoint, key, and station ID to configuration files
  - Created template for API configuration in example config file
  
- **API Integration Utilities**:
  - Created dedicated utility module for BirdWeather API interactions
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Added proper type hints and documentation for all functions

- **Daily Detection Counts Feature**:
  - Implemented function to retrieve daily bird detection counts from the API
  - Support for filtering by species and time periods
  - Proper handling of API responses and error conditions

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**:
  - GraphQL API integration through requests library
  - Modular design following functional programming principles
  - Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
  - Type hints for better code safety and IDE support

- **Configuration**:
  - Enhanced YAML configuration with API settings
  - Secure storage of API credentials
  - Configurable station ID for flexibility

## [2025-03-15] Database Fix: SQLAlchemy Session Management in Weather Updates

### Summary
Fixed a critical issue with SQLAlchemy session management in the weather update process that was causing "detached instance" errors. The application now properly maintains database session context throughout the entire weather update operation, ensuring data integrity and eliminating errors during scheduled updates.

### Key Fixes Implemented
- **Single App Context Pattern**:
  - Modified the weather update process to use a single Flask application context for the entire operation
  - Eliminated separate app contexts for each step of the weather update process
  - Ensured that database objects remain attached to their SQLAlchemy sessions throughout operations
  - Eliminated "Instance not bound to a Session" errors during weather updates

- **Scheduler Session Management**:
  - Improved session handling in the scheduled weather update tasks
  - Added clear documentation about app context requirements in the scheduler
  - Ensured proper Flask application context management for background tasks
  - Fixed the specific error with LocationWeatherConfig objects becoming detached from their sessions

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - Identified that database objects were becoming detached from their sessions when app contexts ended
  - Found that separate app contexts for different update steps was causing session detachment
  - Discovered that background tasks in Flask-APScheduler need special consideration for database sessions
  - Determined that the "refresh operation" error occurred when trying to access a detached instance

- **Implementation Fix**:
  - Consolidated multiple app context blocks into a single context spanning the entire operation
  - Used a consistent pattern for application context management in background tasks
  - Maintained proper session lifecycle throughout the update process
  - Implemented the fix with minimal changes to the existing code structure

### Files Modified
- `dashboard/utils/nws_api.py` - Modified the update_weather_data function to use a single app context
- `dashboard/scheduler.py` - Improved session handling documentation in the scheduled task

### Current Status
The weather update process now works flawlessly without session errors. The scheduler successfully performs updates every 10 minutes with proper database session management. The implementation is robust and has been tested under various conditions to ensure reliability.

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing a more comprehensive session management strategy across the application
- Add additional logging to monitor session lifecycle in background tasks
- Look for other potential areas where session management could be improved
- Consider implementing a session factory pattern for more complex scenarios

  - `dashboard/app.py` - Added scheduler initialization
  - `config/config.yaml` - Added weather settings section
  - `config/config.example.yaml` - Updated example configuration
  - `requirements.txt` - Added Flask-APScheduler dependency

### Current Status
The weather update scheduler is fully implemented and operational. The system automatically fetches current conditions and forecast data every 10 minutes (configurable), ensuring the dashboard always displays up-to-date weather information. The implementation is robust with proper error handling and logging.

### Next Steps
- Create a dashboard UI component to display weather data
- Add visual indicators for weather conditions (icons, etc.)
- Implement weather alerts based on conditions
- Consider adding weather history visualization
- Add option to manually trigger a weather update

# BirdWeather Dashboard Development Diary

## Overview
This diary tracks the development progress of the BirdWeather Dashboard, a web application designed to display bird detection data along with related weather and station information. The dashboard is built using Flask, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## [2023-11-01] Initial Dashboard Implementation

### Summary
Completed the initial implementation of the BirdWeather Dashboard with a responsive design following Bootstrap guidelines. The dashboard displays mock bird detection data, bird details, weather information, and station status.

### Key Features Implemented
- **Bird Detection Data Display**:
  - Table showing detected birds with images, names, counts, and detection times
  - Filtering capabilities (common birds toggle, text search)
  - Time range filtering through dropdown menu
  - Row selection for detailed view

- **Bird Details Panel**:
  - Displays selected bird's image, name, scientific name, and description
  - Automatically shows the first bird's details on page load

- **Weather Information**:
  - Current temperature and conditions
  - Location and date/time information
  - Wind speed and humidity indicators

- **Station Status**:
  - Shows online/offline status
  - Battery level and signal strength
  - Last detection timestamp

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  - Optimized for Raspberry Pi display

- **Image Handling**:
  - Built-in error handling for missing bird images
  - SVG placeholder generation for development/testing
  - Attractive styling for placeholder images

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**:
  - Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout and components
  - Custom CSS for styling beyond Bootstrap defaults
  - Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
  - SVG placeholder images for birds

- **Backend**:
  - Flask web application
  - Configuration through YAML
  - Mock data supplied through JSON file

- **Tools**:
  - Bird image generator script (SVG placeholders)
  - Configuration file for application settings

### Files with Significant Changes
- `dashboard/templates/index.html` - Main dashboard template
- `dashboard/static/css/style.css` - Custom styling
- `dashboard/static/js/main.js` - JavaScript functionality
- `dashboard/app.py` - Flask application
- `docs/mock-data.json` - Mock bird and weather data
- `tools/generate_bird_images.py` - Image generation script
- `config/config.yaml` - Application configuration

### Current Status
The dashboard is fully functional with mock data and can be accessed by running the Flask application. All planned UI components are implemented and working correctly. The application successfully displays bird detection data, allows filtering, and shows detailed information for selected birds.

### Next Steps
- Connect to real data sources instead of mock data
- Implement auto-refresh functionality for live updates
- Add additional filtering options
- Enhance weather data display with forecast information
- Optimize performance for Raspberry Pi deployment
